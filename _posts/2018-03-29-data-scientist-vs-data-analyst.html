<p><em><strong>"Data is the new oil"</strong>, </em>is a statement that's being used almost everywhere you look. Data is now being considered as the most valuable asset in the 21st century and like oil, for those who see data's essential value and learn to extract and use it, there will be huge rewards. This buzz has forced nearly all companies to start collecting data in different forms while hiring various professionals in the data industry such as data analysts, business analysts, data scientists, data engineers and so on to comb through their data and find insights that will be beneficial to the company as well as help them drive business decisions effectively.</p>
<p>Most people including executives at these companies have heard about data science and data analytics with little to no knowledge of what these roles actually do. These roles have been around for quite sometime now and was recently called "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century" by the <a title="Harvard Business Review" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Business_Review">Harvard Business Review</a> , which has also driven people from all industries to go online in search of data science and analysis certifications. Truth be told, there's nothing sexy about data science.</p>
<p>So, you've heard of the job title "data analyst" or "data scientist" lately and it sounds like an intriguing career, the idea of working with data and technology has intrigued you, but what do people in these roles do? are they similar? If not, what makes them different from each other? I've come across these questions a lot. A major reason for this ambiguity is that the industry is quite new and a lot of companies have different definitions of what a data scientist or a data analyst is based on their needs and preferences.</p>
<p>First of all, data scientists and analysts have one common goal which is: to apply analysis in data and get insights from it. However, there are other tasks that overlap these two roles and there's this misconception that they are both the same but I tend to disagree as we'll see in this post.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This post will not share the tools one needs to equip themselves to be either a data analyst or a data scientist, neither will it show the approximate salaries, but will try to define what these roles entail. I'll share some useful links that talk about the skills one needs to have be a data analyst or data scientist at the bottom of the post.</p>
<h4>DATA ANALYST</h4>
<blockquote><p><strong><b>Data analysis</b></strong> is a process of inspecting, <a title="Data cleansing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing">cleansing</a>, <a title="Data transformation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation">transforming</a>, and <a title="Data modeling" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling">modeling</a> <a title="Data" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> with the goal of discovering useful information, suggesting conclusions, and supporting decision-making.</p>
<p>-Wikipedia</p></blockquote>
<p>When I come across the term data analysis, all I can picture is reports, visualizations, dashboards and the stock market for some reason. Some common data analyst job duties involve some of those things including, spotting patterns, collecting data, communicating results of the analysis and so on.</p>
<p>In this medium <a href="https://medium.com/@rchang/my-two-year-journey-as-a-data-scientist-at-twitter-f0c13298aee6">post</a> Robert Chang, a former data scientist at Twitter defines a data analyst as a <strong>Type "A" Data Scientist</strong> where he says: <em>"The A is for Analysis. This type is primarily concerned with making sense of data or working with it in a fairly static way. The Type A Data Scientist is very similar to a statistician (and may be one) but knows all the practical details of working with data that aren’t taught in the statistics curriculum: data cleaning, methods for dealing with very large data sets, visualization, deep knowledge of a particular domain, writing well about data, and so on</em>.”</p>
<p>In a nutshell, a <strong>Data Analyst or Business Intelligence Engineer or an Analyst </strong> is a person who can do <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/descriptive_statistics.asp">descriptive statistics</a>, visualize data and communicate data points which lead to conclusions. In other words, they use data to gain meaningful insights and solve problems. Data analysts analyze well defined data i.e. <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/structured_data.html">structured data</a> to answer business related questions such as <em>which product generates the most revenue, Which customers purchase the most products, what time is best to reach out to customers, why sales dropped at a certain quarter and so much more. </em>Companies in nearly every industry hire data analysts from retail shops, fast food vendors, healthcare providers and more.</p>
<p>From what I have  come to learn over the past couple of months, a data analyst is like a mini data scientist. Most of the time, a data scientist will find themselves doing a tone of data analyst work before building complex algorithms. If the data scientist is lucky enough to be in a company with a data team, they'll probably forgo the hustle of collecting, cleaning and pre-processing the data, which is part of what the analyst does.</p>
<h4>DATA SCIENTIST</h4>
<blockquote><p><b>Data science</b>, also known as <b>data-driven science</b>, is an interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract <a title="Knowledge" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge">knowledge</a> or insights from <a title="Data" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> in various forms, either structured or unstructured,<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-0" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup>similar to <a title="Data mining" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">data mining</a>.</p>
<p>-Wikipedia</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, Robert Chang defines this kind of a data scientist as a <strong>Type "B" Data </strong><b>Scientist. </b>Where he says: <em>"The B is for Building. Type B Data Scientists share some statistical background with Type A, but they are also very strong coders and may be trained software engineers. The Type B Data Scientist is mainly interested in using data “in production.” They build models which interact with users, often serving recommendations (products, people you may know, ads, movies, search results)."</em></p>
<p><strong>Data Scientists</strong> are expected to go much deeper in terms of analysis by gathering loads of data which may be unstructured, structured or semi-structured that's been accumulated across various sources and put them in a proper dataset on which machine learning is applied to perform predictive analytics, sentiment analysis e.t.c to extract information from the data that's been collected. They tend to estimate what is unknown by asking the right questions, writing complex algorithms and building models. Some people define a data scientist as <em>a person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.</em></p>
<p>A data scientist if I must say, needs to learn a lot more coding languages than a data analyst. I might be wrong about this because in the <strong><a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Data+Smart%3A+Using+Data+Science+to+Transform+Information+into+Insight-p-9781118661468">Data Smart Book</a>, </strong>John W. Foreman shows how one can use spreadsheets to process raw data into actionable insights. He goes ahead to perform things like<strong> K-means clustering</strong>, building<strong> Optimization models</strong> e.t.c within the familiar environment of a spreadsheet. But I would assume that only works with a considerable amount of data.</p>
<p>Data science is a large field which entails very many things that are but not limited to: <em>Natural Language processing, Deep Learning, predictive analytics, building recommendation systems, sentiment analysis and unsupervised learning</em>. Looking for a job as a data scientist? I found <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-two-sides-of-getting-a-job-as-a-data-scientist-a4571acc58bc">this</a> great read that will help you get started. You could also look at <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-getting-a-job-in-data-science-might-look-like-f94ddb788a5e">this</a> one as well.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Data Analyst != Data Scientist</p>
<p>But a Data Scientist can also be a Data Analyst.</p>
<p>I would also love to get some thoughts you might have on this topic.</p>
