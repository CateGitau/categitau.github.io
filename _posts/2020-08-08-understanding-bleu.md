**Bilingual Evaluation Understudy(BLEU)** is an algorithm that is used for evaluating the quality of texts that have been machine translated from one language to another. It is one of the most popular metrics that's being used to evaluate sequence to sequence tasks such as machine translation. However, regardless of the fact that it's being used by many, BLEU has some drawbacks. This article aims at identifying the drawbacks BLEU has and comparing it to other various machine translation evaluation metrics that are better than it.

Here's what we will cover:
