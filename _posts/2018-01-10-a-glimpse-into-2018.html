<p>First off, I'd like to wish you all a Happy New Year!</p>
<p>On that note, what's a new year post without setting some new year <del datetime="2018-01-08T11:13:06+00:00">resolutions</del> goals?<!--more--></p>
<p>I'm always skeptical about sharing my goals with people because sometimes nothing gets really done, and by sharing them, I feel like it sometimes changes the purpose from focusing on the process to achieve the goal to trying to justify to my friends that I can actually keep to my goals and attain them and if I don't, then I'm a sucker and that's not the case. Also, I love the feeling that comes with sharing an achievement with people who weren't expecting it.</p>
<p>It took me a while to decide what my first post this year will be about and I hate myself for conforming to this "new year goals" trend, but what the heck.</p>
<p>This short post will outline not goals but some of the things I'm looking forward to regarding data science. Which basically are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning something new</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In this world of data science, you just can't stop learning. I literally come across something new every single day. But what I mean is learning a totally different thing from what I've been up to in the last couple of months. Maybe get my hands dirty and learn me some <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensor flow</a>? Neural Nets? BI? Apache Spark? We'll see. Really excited about this.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contributing to others' data science paths</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This includes writing content that helps people out there who are starting out on data science and I am also excited to be a part of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Nairobi-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science/">WiMLDS</a> community here in Nairobi, Kenya. Hoping to meet you at one of the meetups!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finish a Kaggle competition</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ever since I joined Kaggle, I've always left competitions unfinished. I've never even finished the beginner titanic one, but I learnt a lot on data exploration from it. So, this year I'll work towards completing at least one. Yay to that!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More and more conferences</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not the least, I am looking forward to attending as many conferences as I possibly can this year. This way, I can get to share ideas and experiences with more people who are members of the Data science community, build my network and possibly attain new skills.</p>
<p>Let's see what 2018 has in store for us!</p>
