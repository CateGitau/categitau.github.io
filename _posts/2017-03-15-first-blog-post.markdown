Whoop....welcome to my first blog post!

First things first, who am I? why have I decided to start blogging? and what do I intend to do with my blog?

**Who am I?**

At this time, I'm just a final year student at the Jomo Kenytatta University of Agriculture and Technology pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Computer science, majoring in statistics (_Best decision I've ever made! _I'll get back to this in a later post).

**The Why**

I learnt something from one of my favorite motivational speakers:


<blockquote>“People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it. And what you do simply proves what you believe”
― [Simon Sinek](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3158574.Simon_Sinek), [Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/7367737)</blockquote>


Everyone needs to know their why. Why they are doing things they do, by why I mean their purpose or cause - Why do you wake up every morning to go to work? Why do you go to school? Why does your company exist? Why do you do the things you do? Knowing your why is what keeps you going, it's what gets you motivated and ready to face the world every morning. Since this is my first blog post, I’d like to jot down my why, this will be the reason I’ll come back and add content to my blog.

So anyway, I recently discovered that blogging can be a fantastic way to demonstrate my skills, learn topics in more depth through research and also build an audience. Being in my final year, I believe that this will be a great way to share what I know, learn by sharing and display my skills through projects that I've done and just everything I’m interested in in general.

**What?**

So, what do I intend to post on this blog? Well, a couple of months ago, I discovered my niche...wait for it.........drum roll......**DATA SCIENCE!** and everything data! So, this blog will be somewhat my journal, displaying things that I've learnt about data science, everything data and post my projects for people to comment on, and discuss.

So let's get Numpying!..get it?Numpy?.. Numpying..Never mind, bad Joke, bad joke!
